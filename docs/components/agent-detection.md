# Agent Detection

> How Prowl knows there's an agent in a pane and whether it's Working, Blocked,
> Idle, or Done — and which agents it recognizes.

## What it is

Prowl continuously inspects each terminal pane to decide whether a coding agent is
running and what state it's in. That signal drives the
[Active Agents panel](active-agents.md), the per-tab activity indicator,
[Canvas](canvas.md) cards lighting up, and [notifications](notifications.md).

## Agents it recognizes

Claude (Claude Code), Codex, Gemini, Cursor, Cline, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot,
Kimi, Droid, Amp, Pi (`pi`), and Oh My Pi (`omp`, `oh-my-pi`). Detection covers
common wrappers (node, python, bun, bash, etc.) so agents launched indirectly are
still found. Oh My Pi reuses Pi-derived screen heuristics but uses its own command
icon where Prowl shows detected command icons, including terminal tabs.

## How detection works (two stages)

1. **Process probe.** Prowl reads the pane's foreground process group and matches
   process names / argv against known agent executables, scoring argv[0] highest,
   then process name, then command-line tokens.
2. **Screen heuristics.** It scans the last ~24 non-blank lines of the pane for
   agent-specific UI cues — e.g. "Esc to interrupt", Oh My Pi's `Working… ⟦esc⟧`
   loader or braille spinner status line (working), confirmation/permission prompts
   (blocked), idle prompts. Each agent family has its own patterns (including spinner glyphs:
   braille frames, symbol cycles, Cursor's hexagons, Kimi's moon phases, etc.).

To avoid flicker, detection **stabilizes**: it tolerates several consecutive
misses before declaring an agent gone, and a working agent gets a short (~3s)
hold so brief pauses between thinking and output don't drop it out of
"working" (a genuine finish therefore reports up to ~3s late; "blocked"
bypasses the hold and surfaces immediately). Viewer overlays (Claude's
transcript / history-search views) cover the live status area, so frames
showing their chrome keep the last trusted state instead of forcing idle.

## The state machine

**Raw states:** `working`, `blocked`, `idle`, `unknown`.

**Display states** (what you see):

| Display | Derived from | Meaning |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Working** | raw `working` | actively processing |
| **Blocked** | raw `blocked` | waiting for the user (a prompt) |
| **Done** | raw `idle` + **unseen** | just finished; you haven't looked yet |
| **Idle** | raw `idle` + **seen** | nothing running |

A **Done** pane becomes **Idle** the moment you focus it.

## How often it runs

- **No polling** for cold panes that have not received recent input.
- ~**2 s** for a short warm window after typing, paste, CLI input, or an initial
  command starts in the pane.
- ~**300 ms** once an agent is detected, so Working/Blocked/Done stays responsive.

The heavier process probe is throttled (cached ≈ 0.75 s per process group unless
something changes) so many panes don't add up to high CPU. Status indicators redraw on a
coarse tick rather than every frame for the same reason.

## The indicator

In tabs and the Active Agents panel, a **Working** agent shows an animated spinner
(the per-agent style detected on screen); **Blocked** is a distinct
attention color; **Idle/Done** are static. The "working" animation style is also
configurable in spirit — Prowl uses a bagua/trigram-style spinner in the agents
list.

## Settings

Agent detection is on by default. Related toggles live in the Active Agents and
Notifications settings (e.g. `autoShowActiveAgentsPanel`,
`showActiveAgentTabTitles`).

## Gotchas for agents

- Detection is **heuristic and best-effort**. A short-lived command between polls
  can be missed; an unusual prompt might read as the wrong state.
- **"Blocked"** is the one that means *a human is needed* — it's typically a
  permission/confirmation prompt the agent is waiting on.
- For deterministic automation, don't rely on the visual status; use
  [`prowl list`](cli.md) (`task.status`) and confirm a screen is finished with
  `prowl read --wait-stable` — `task.status` can flip to idle before a TUI has
  painted its last frame.
