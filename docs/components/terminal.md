# Terminal — Tabs, Splits & Panes

> The terminal layer: tabs within a worktree, splitting a tab into panes, the

## What it is

Inside each worktree you get terminal **tabs**. Each tab is a layout of one or
more **panes** (a.k.a. surfaces) — split horizontally/vertically — rendered by the
embedded **Ghostty** engine. One worktree → many tabs → each tab → one or more
panes.

```
Worktree
└─ Tab  (has a title + icon)
   └─ Pane / surface  (a live Ghostty terminal; tabs can hold several, split)
```

A single Ghostty app instance hosts every pane as an independent surface, which is
why Prowl is fully native and CJK-correct.

## Tabs

| Operation | How |
|-----------|-----|
| New tab | Terminal menu → **New Terminal** (Ghostty `new_tab`, typically `⌘T`); the **+** on a Shelf spine; the [`prowl tab create`](cli.md) CLI |
| Select tab 1–9 | `⌘1`–`⌘9` |
| Previous / Next tab | `⌘⇧[` / `⌘⇧]` |
| Close focused tab | Terminal menu → **Close Terminal Tab** (Ghostty `close_tab`) |
| Close (right-click a tab) | Close Tab · Close Other Tabs · Close Tabs to the Right · Close All |
| Rename tab | Right-click → **Rename Tab** (sets a custom title) |
| Change tab icon | Right-click → **Change Tab Icon** (pick an SF Symbol) |
| Reorder tabs | Drag tabs in the tab bar |

In **Shelf** view, tabs of the open book are also cycled with `⌘⌃↑` / `⌘⌃↓`.

## Splits (panes)

Splitting is handled by Ghostty actions (bind/keys in your Ghostty config):

| Operation | Ghostty action |
|-----------|----------------|
| New split (vertical / right) | `new_split:right` |
| New split (horizontal / down) | `new_split:down` |
| Focus adjacent pane | `goto_split:left/right/up/down`, or the app shortcuts below |
| Resize split | `resize_split:<dir>:<px>` |
| Equalize splits | `equalize_splits` |
| Zoom / maximize a pane | `toggle_split_zoom` |
| Close a pane | `close_surface` (Terminal menu → **Close Terminal**) |

App-level pane navigation (works inside the terminal too): `⌘[` / `⌘]` previous /
next pane, `⌘⌥↑/↓/←/→` for directional pane focus. Shelf spines also expose
**split vertical / split horizontal** buttons on the open book.

## Tab titles — important caveat

A tab's displayed title is, in order of precedence:
1. a **custom title** you set via Rename Tab, else
2. the **live shell title** the running program emits (OSC 2), else
3. an auto-generated default like `project 1`, `project 2`.

The Run Script tab is labeled **RUN SCRIPT** and is **title-locked** for its
lifetime. Prowl also "learns" your shell's idle prompt so it doesn't mistake it
for a meaningful title.

> **Titles are free-form and can lie or lag.** Any program can set any title.
> When automating, never target a pane by its title — use the stable `pane.id`
> from [`prowl list`](cli.md). The bundled [`prowl-cli` skill](cli.md) repeats
> this for good reason.

## Tab icons

Tabs get an auto-detected icon based on what's running (e.g. an agent's icon),
which you can override (Change Tab Icon) or which a script can set. Icon
precedence is `auto < script < user`.

## Shell integration & status (OSC sequences)

Ghostty's shell integration drives several Prowl features via terminal escape
sequences:

- **OSC 133** (prompt/command marks) — lets Prowl know when a command **starts and
  finishes** and its **exit code**. This powers command-finished notifications,
  auto-close-on-success, and the `prowl send --capture` output capture.
- **OSC 2** (title) — feeds tab titles and agent/icon detection.
- **Progress reports** — agents/commands report busy/idle, feeding the tab's
  activity indicator and task status.
- **Bell / desktop notification** — increments unread indicators.

`--capture` in the CLI **requires OSC 133** on the target pane; without it you get
`CAPTURE_UNSUPPORTED` (read the screen with `read --wait-stable` instead).

## Command-finished behavior

When a command finishes (via OSC 133), Prowl can:
- fire a **notification** if it ran longer than the threshold (default 10s) — see
  [notifications](notifications.md);
- **auto-close** the tab/pane if it was launched with "close on success" and the
  exit code is 0;
- skip the notification for user-initiated exits (Ctrl-C → 130, SIGTERM → 143) or
  if you typed in that pane within the last ~3 seconds.

## Font size

- **Reset / Increase / Decrease** via the Terminal menu (Ghostty
  `reset_font_size` / `increase_font_size:1` / `decrease_font_size:1`; usually
  `⌘0` / `⌘+` / `⌘-`).
- The chosen size is remembered (`terminalFontSize`) and applied across worktrees;
  new tabs and splits inherit the focused pane's size.

## In-terminal search

Terminal menu: **Find…** (`start_search`), **Find Next/Previous**
(`search:next`/`search:previous`), **Hide Find Bar** (`end_search`), **Use
Selection for Find** (`search_selection`). These are Ghostty-managed.

## Scrollback, CJK, copy/paste

Scrollback, wide/CJK character rendering, and copy/paste are handled by Ghostty
with its defaults — Prowl doesn't override them. Customize terminal behavior in
your Ghostty config at `~/.config/ghostty/config`.

## Color scheme

The terminal theme automatically follows the macOS light/dark appearance. There's
no in-app Ghostty theme picker; change Ghostty colors via its config file.

## Layout persistence

If `restoreTerminalLayoutOnLaunch` is enabled, Prowl saves the tab/split layout
(which worktrees, tabs, split trees, titles, icons) and restores it on next
launch. Notification bodies are not persisted.

## Gotchas for agents

- **Tab selection ≠ pane focus.** A tab can have several panes; selecting a tab
  doesn't pin which split has keyboard focus. The CLI's `pane.focused` is the
  truth.
- Closing the **last** tab leaves the worktree with no visible terminal (Shelf
  removes the book; Canvas drops the card).
- `--capture` and stable reads depend on the pane's shell integration; agents
  running full-screen TUIs may need `read --wait-stable` rather than `--capture`.
