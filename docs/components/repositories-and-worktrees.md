# Repositories & Git Worktrees

> The sidebar and everything in it: adding projects, and creating, opening,
> archiving, and deleting git worktrees — the unit of work you hand to an agent.

## What it is

The left **sidebar** lists your **repositories**, each expandable into its
**worktrees**. A repository is a git project (or a plain non-git folder) you've
added. A worktree is one branch checked out into its own directory, so multiple
branches are live on disk at once — ideal for giving each agent its own branch.

Within a repository, worktrees are grouped: **Main** (the repo root), **Pinned**,
**Pending** (being created), and the rest. Each row shows the name, branch detail,
an unread-notification bell, and run/agent status.

## Repository kinds

| Kind | Worktrees | Branches | Diff | PRs | Run scripts |
|------|-----------|----------|------|-----|-------------|
| **git** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **plain** (non-git folder) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

A plain folder can't expand; clicking it just opens a terminal there. Prowl
auto-detects which kind a path is when you add it (it runs `git` to find the repo
root; "not a git repository" → plain folder).

## Adding a repository

- **Shortcut:** `⌘⇧O` (`open_repository`)
- **Toolbar:** the **Add Repository** button (folder-with-plus icon) at the top of
  the sidebar.
- **Command Palette:** "Open Repository".

Pick one or more directories. Prowl detects git vs plain, de-duplicates, and
persists the list. Paths that don't exist or can't be read are reported in an
alert after the load.

## Creating a worktree

- **Shortcut:** `⌘N` (`new_worktree`)
- **Button:** the **+** on a repository's header (only for git repos that support
  worktrees).
- **Command Palette:** "New Worktree".

By default a **creation prompt** appears (controlled by
`promptForWorktreeCreation`) where you:
- enter a **branch name** (leave blank to auto-generate, e.g. `bold-cat-523`),
- choose the **base ref** (branch/tag) to branch from,
- optionally **fetch the remote first**.

An optional, default-collapsed **Advanced** section lets you override where the
worktree lands:
- **Worktree name** — the leaf folder name (defaults to the branch name).
- **Parent folder** — the directory it's created in (defaults to the repo's
  resolved base directory).

Leave both blank to keep the default `base/<branch>` placement. The footer shows
the full destination path as you type, or an inline error (the worktree name is a
single folder, so slashes, `.`/`..`, and `.git` are rejected).

Press **↩** to create, **Esc** to cancel. Branch names are validated live
(`git check-ref-format`).

**Creation runs through the bundled `wt` CLI** (`Resources/git-wt`) and streams
progress through stages: reading local branches → choosing a name → checking repo
mode → resolving the base ref → fetching → creating. A **Pending** row shows the
live status until it's ready.

**Copying uncommitted files:** new worktrees can optionally copy `.gitignore`'d
files (`copyIgnoredOnWorktreeCreate`) and/or untracked files
(`copyUntrackedOnWorktreeCreate`) from the source — set globally or per repo.

**Setup script:** if the repo defines a setup script, it runs automatically in the
new worktree (see [custom-actions](custom-actions.md)).

## Selecting & switching worktrees

- **Click** a row to select it (focuses its terminal).
- **`⌃1`–`⌃9`** jump to worktree 1–9.
- **`⌘⌃↓` / `⌘⌃↑`** select next / previous worktree.
- **`⌘⌥[` / `⌘⌥]`** go back / forward through worktree selection history.
- **`⌘⇧L`** reveals the currently focused worktree in the sidebar.

## Pinning & ordering

- **Pin / Unpin:** hover a worktree → pin button, or right-click → "Pin to top" /
  "Unpin". Pinned worktrees sit in a section above the rest. (Not available for
  the main worktree.)
- **Reorder:** drag repositories or worktrees to rearrange; a thin accent line
  shows the drop target. Order is persisted.
- **Expand / Collapse:** click the chevron on a repo header, or use the sidebar's
  **Expand All / Collapse All** buttons. Collapsed state is remembered.

## Archiving a worktree

Archiving hides a worktree from the main list without deleting it.

- **Right-click** the row → "Archive Worktree" (or "Archive Selected Worktrees"
  with a multi-selection). No default keyboard shortcut.
- If the branch is already **merged**, Prowl archives immediately without asking.
- If the repo defines an **archive script**, it runs first (live progress); if it
  fails, archiving stops and the worktree stays active.
- **View archived:** `⌘⌃A` opens the Archived Worktrees panel, grouped by repo,
  with **Unarchive** and **Delete Selected** (`⌘⇧⌫`) buttons.
- **Auto-delete:** if `archivedAutoDeletePeriod` is set, archived worktrees older
  than the period are deleted automatically.

The **main worktree cannot be archived.**

## Deleting a worktree

Deleting removes the worktree directory (and optionally its branch).

- **Right-click** the row → "Delete Worktree", or **`⌘⇧⌫`**.
- A confirmation dialog offers an **"Also delete local branch"** toggle (its
  tooltip notes `git branch -d`). Default behavior comes from
  `deleteBranchOnDeleteWorktree`.
- Prowl removes the worktree (relocating + `git worktree prune` if needed). If
  branch deletion is rejected because the branch isn't merged, it offers a
  **force delete** (`git branch -D`).
- Protected branches (`main`, `master`, and the detected default) are guarded.

The **main worktree cannot be deleted.**

## Removing a repository

Right-click a repo header → "Remove Repository" (or the **⋯** menu). This removes
it from Prowl (closing its open terminals); it does **not** delete files on disk.

## Opening a worktree in another app

`⌘O` opens the worktree with the selected open action. When the action is
**Automatic** (the default), Prowl inspects the worktree's top-level files and
prefers an app matching the project type: `.xcodeproj`/`.xcworkspace`/
`Package.swift`/`Project.swift` → Xcode, Gradle files → Android Studio (then
IntelliJ IDEA), `*.sln`/`*.csproj` → Rider, `pom.xml` → IntelliJ IDEA,
`go.mod` → GoLand, `Cargo.toml` → RustRover, `CMakeLists.txt` → CLion,
`composer.json` → PhpStorm, `Gemfile` → RubyMine, Python manifests → PyCharm,
`package.json` → WebStorm. If the matching app isn't installed (or no project
type is detected), it falls back to the generic priority — your first
installed editor (Cursor → Zed → VS Code → Windsurf → …), falling through to
Xcode and then **Finder only when no preferred app is found**. Use the
**Open** dropdown in the worktree's detail toolbar to pick a different app
(this pins it for the repo), or pick **Automatic** at the top of that dropdown
to clear the pin and return to project-aware selection. You can also set a
per-repo default (`openActionID`) / global default (`defaultEditorID`). Prowl
detects: Finder, Terminal,
`$EDITOR`, VS Code (+ Insiders), VSCodium, Cursor, Zed, Windsurf, Antigravity,
Sublime Text, Xcode, Android Studio, JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm,
PyCharm, RustRover, Rider, GoLand, CLion, PhpStorm, RubyMine), GitHub Desktop
/ Fork / Tower / GitKraken / Sourcetree / Sublime Merge / SmartGit / GitUp,
and terminals (Alacritty, Ghostty, iTerm2, Kitty, Warp, WezTerm). If the
chosen app isn't installed, Prowl shows an alert.

Other per-row context-menu items: **Copy Path**, **Reveal in Finder**. (Repo
Settings lives on the repository **header** menu, not the worktree row.)

## Repository appearance (icon & color)

In **Repo Settings** you can give each repository an **icon** (any SF Symbol from
a curated set, a bundled asset, or your own image) and a **color** (10 presets or
a custom color). The color tints the icon, the name, the Shelf spine (if
`shelfSpineTintFollowsRepositoryColor`), and the window chrome (if
`windowTintMode = repositoryColor`). You can also set a **custom display title**
(`customTitle`) that overrides the folder name.

## Lifecycle states (what the row can show)

- **Pending** — worktree is being created (grey row, live stage text).
- **Creating / Archiving / Removing** — transient loading states with progress.
- **Running** — a Run Script or agent task is active in that worktree.
- **Unread bell** — the worktree has unseen notifications.

## Settings that affect this area

Global (Settings → Worktree / General) and per-repository (Repo Settings) — see
[`reference/settings-fields.md`](../reference/settings-fields.md) for the full
list. Highlights:

- `promptForWorktreeCreation`, `fetchOriginBeforeWorktreeCreation`
- `defaultWorktreeBaseDirectoryPath` / per-repo `worktreeBaseDirectoryPath`
- per-repo `worktreeBaseRef` (default base branch)
- `copyIgnoredOnWorktreeCreate`, `copyUntrackedOnWorktreeCreate`
- `deleteBranchOnDeleteWorktree`, `mergedWorktreeAction`, `archivedAutoDeletePeriod`
- per-repo `setupScript`, `archiveScript`, `openActionID`, `customTitle`

## Gotchas for agents

- The **main worktree** (`isMain`) is special: no archive/delete/rename.
- Worktree **names are auto-generated** (`adjective-animal-number`) unless the user
  named them — don't assume the name reflects the branch's purpose.
- Removing a repository does **not** delete files; deleting a worktree **does**
  remove its directory (and optionally its branch).
- A worktree's `id` is its **path** (with trailing-slash normalization) — the same
  identifier the [`prowl` CLI](cli.md) uses.
