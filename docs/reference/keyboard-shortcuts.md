# Reference: Keyboard Shortcuts

> The complete, authoritative shortcut table. Source of truth:
> `supacode/App/AppShortcuts.swift` (app actions) and `supacode/Commands/*.swift`
> (menu wiring). Terminal-level keys come from the Ghostty engine.

**Keywords:** keyboard, shortcuts, hotkeys, keybindings, key bindings, remap, ⌘, command, shortcut list

Symbols: **⌘** Command · **⇧** Shift · **⌥** Option · **⌃** Control · **↩** Return · **⌫** Delete · arrows ↑ ↓ ← →

> **Defaults shown.** Most rows are user-remappable (see
> [Remapping](#remapping--customization)). To see a human's _live_ binding, the
> [Command Palette](../components/command-palette.md) displays the resolved key
> next to each action. Automation should use the [`prowl` CLI](../components/cli.md),
> which never depends on keybindings.

## Terminal tabs & panes

These app actions are also registered with Ghostty, so they work while a terminal
pane has focus. The Ghostty action each maps to is shown for reference.

| Action | Default | Command ID | Ghostty action |
|--------|---------|------------|----------------|
| Select Terminal Tab 1–9 | ⌘1 … ⌘9 | `select_terminal_tab_1` … `_9` | `goto_tab:N` |

| Select Previous Pane | ⌘[ | `select_previous_terminal_pane` | `goto_split:previous` |
| Select Next Pane | ⌘] | `select_next_terminal_pane` | `goto_split:next` |

| Find Next | ⌘G | `find_next` | — |
| Find Previous | ⌘⇧G | `find_previous` | — |

## Terminal engine (Ghostty-managed)

These are **not** Prowl app shortcuts; they are Ghostty terminal bindings, shown
in Prowl's Terminal menu with whatever key Ghostty resolves. Customize them in
your Ghostty config (`~/.config/ghostty/config`). Typical defaults in parentheses.

| Action | Ghostty action | Typical default |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| New Terminal (tab) | `new_tab` | ⌘T |
| Close Terminal (pane/surface) | `close_surface` | ⌘W |
| Close Terminal Tab | `close_tab` | ⌘⇧W |
| New Split (vertical / horizontal) | `new_split:right` / `new_split:down` | (Ghostty default; config-only, not in the Terminal menu) |
| Reset Font Size | `reset_font_size` | ⌘0 |
| Increase Font Size | `increase_font_size:1` | ⌘+ |
| Decrease Font Size | `decrease_font_size:1` | ⌘- |
| Hide Find Bar | `end_search` | Esc |
| Use Selection for Find | `search_selection` | ⌘E |

## App & global

| Action | Default | Command ID | Remappable |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| Command Palette | ⌘P | `command_palette` | yes |
| Open Settings | ⌘, | `open_settings` | yes |
| Run Script | ⌘R | `run_script` | yes |
| Stop Script | ⌘. | `stop_script` | yes |
| Check for Updates | ⌘⇧U | `check_for_updates` | yes |
| Quit Application | ⌘Q | `quit_application` | **no** (fixed) |

Plus any per-repository **Custom Commands**, which can each carry their own
hotkey — see [`components/custom-actions.md`](../components/custom-actions.md).

## Remapping & customization

- **App actions** (scope `configurableAppAction`) are remappable in
  **Settings → Shortcuts**. Overrides are stored in
  `~/.prowl/settings.json` under `keybindingUserOverrides`.
- **`quit_application`** is fixed (`systemFixedAppAction`) — it can't be remapped.
- **Canvas/local actions** (`localInteraction`, e.g. Arrange/Organize/Expand,
  Rename Branch) are remappable and conflict-checked against all remappable actions.
- **Custom Command** hotkeys are repo-scoped and take precedence over app
  shortcuts within the focused repository; conflicts are surfaced when recording.
- **Terminal engine keys** are owned by Ghostty. Prowl automatically *unbinds*
  any Ghostty key that collides with an app shortcut, and re-binds the
  tab/pane-navigation actions into Ghostty so they work inside the terminal. You
  customize the rest in `~/.config/ghostty/config`.

## Notes for agents

- These are **defaults**. If a human says "my `⌘P` does X", trust them — they may
  have remapped it. The CLI is binding-independent; prefer it for automation.
- When two rows look like they share keys (e.g. `⌥⌃↑/↓` for agent navigation vs
  `⌘⌥↑/↓` for pane navigation), check the **modifiers carefully** — Control vs
  Command distinguishes them.
- `select_previous/next_worktree` (⌘⌃↑/↓) is overloaded by design: in Shelf view
  it cycles the open book's **tabs**; elsewhere it changes the selected worktree.
